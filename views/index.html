      <p class="govuk-body">The Companies House API and Developer Hub are currently at a beta release. We are going through a process of user engagement to improve the API and documentation.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We have a proposed approach to versioning the API and documentation that is currently being discussed in the Developer Hub Forum. In the meantime existing resources will remain 'as is' and can be considered as at 'version 0'.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Please refer to the Developer Hub Forum for ongoing feature and documentation discussions, and announcements on upcoming feature releases.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Getting started</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you are new to the Companies House API, we recommend you take a look at the getting started guide, with the resources and examples provided there to help you.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We also have a support forum where you can discuss the API, find help and provide feedback.</p>

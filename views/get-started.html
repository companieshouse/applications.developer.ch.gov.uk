        <a href="sign-in.html">register a user account</a>
        with Companies House to explore and perform tests with the Companies House API.
      </p>
      <p>Quick start tip: each Companies House API reference page contains an embedded explorer to try out the service without having to write any client code.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the Companies House API
      </h2>
      <p>Companies House digitally records almost all the information it receives and makes this available to the public through its website and through the Companies House RESTful API.
      </p>
      <p>Being RESTful, each record of information is assigned a globally unique URI, and the operations available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs. Data can be easily consumed by issuing simple GET requests on the required resource URI.
      </p>
      <p>Read the
        <a href="rest-api-overview.html">Companies House REST API overview</a>
        for more information about our API approach, REST web services and the JSON data format.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">API key authentication
      </h2>
      <p>Access to API services requires authentication. The Companies House API requires authentication credentials to be sent with each request, which take the form of an API key.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">API key authentication
      </h2>
      <p>The Companies House API requires authentication credentials to be sent with each request, which take the form of an API key.</p>
      <p>To add an API key:
      </p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Go to Application overview.</li>
        <li>Select the application youâ€™d like to add a key to, or select Add an application to create a new one.
        </li>
        <li>Select Add new key at the bottom of the page.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a name for the key and choose the client type.
        </li>
        <li>Select Create.
        </li>
        <li>A unique key will be generated, which can be sent with any GET request for a public resource served by the Companies House API.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Sending the API key
      </h2>
      <p>The Companies House API uses HTTP basic access authentication to send an API key between the client application and the server.
      </p>
      <p>Basic authentication is usually made up of a username and password. The Companies House API takes the username as the API key and ignores the password, so it can be left blank.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Example
      </h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">HTTP Basic Authentication
      </h3>
      <p>For an API key of my_api_key, the following curl request demonstrates the setting of the Authorization HTTP request header, as defined by RFC2617.
      </p>
      <p>curl -XGET -u my_api_key: https://api.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00000006 GET /company/00000006 HTTP/1.1 Host: api.companieshouse.gov.uk Authorization: Basic bXlfYXBpX2tleTo=
